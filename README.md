# Calculus Notes

This is an archive of the 110 some pages of Calculus notes that I wrote while taking AP Calc BC in my sophomore year. It got to be a bit too much work to maintain after getting to integrals, and I realized that I was basically writing a textbook in some regards, so I stopped, but it was still a fun experience and it was one of my first big LaTeX projects. This doesn't really cover all of the Calc AB curriculum either, but perhaps I'll come back to finish it sometime.
